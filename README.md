# DSPark

**A professional, header-only audio DSP framework in pure C++20. Zero external dependencies.**

**v1.0** — 72 headers. One `#include`. Ready to build plugins, desktop apps, WebAssembly, mobile, embedded.

```cpp
#include "DSPark/DSPark.h"

dspark::Equalizer<float> eq;
dspark::Compressor<float> comp;
dspark::AlgorithmicReverb<float> reverb;

eq.prepare(spec);
comp.prepare(spec);
reverb.prepare(spec);

eq.setBand(0, 100.0f, 3.0f);            // Boost bass
comp.setThreshold(-18.0f);               // Compress
comp.setCharacter(dspark::Compressor<float>::Character::FET);  // 1176-style
reverb.setType(dspark::AlgorithmicReverb<float>::Type::Hall);  // Concert hall

eq.processBlock(buffer);
comp.processBlock(buffer);
reverb.processBlock(buffer);
```

No build system. No linking. No configuration. Just include and go.

## Why DSPark

Most audio DSP libraries fall into two categories: either they require a massive framework dependency, or they cover only a narrow slice of what you need. Nothing gives you everything in a single, portable, dependency-free package.

DSPark was built to change that. Whether you are:

- **A software developer** adding audio features to an app (zero DSP knowledge required)
- **A mixing engineer or sound technician** building custom plugins and tools
- **A DSP engineer** designing professional audio processors or embedded systems

You get the same framework, the same headers, the same API. The difference is how deep you go.

### Progressive Disclosure API

Every processor exposes three levels of complexity:

```cpp
// Level 1 — Just works:
eq.setBand(0, 1000.0f, -3.0f);

// Level 2 — More control:
eq.setBand(0, 1000.0f, -3.0f, 1.5f);   // Adds Q factor

// Level 3 — Full control:
eq.setBand(0, { .frequency = 1000, .gain = -3, .q = 1.5,
                .type = BandType::LowShelf, .slope = 24 });
```

You never see complexity you don't need. But it's always there when you do.

### Extensible by Design

Every effect class features virtual destructors and protected internals. Build professional products on top:

```cpp
class MyReverb : public dspark::AlgorithmicReverb<float> {
    // Access FDN delay lines, absorption filters, early reflections...
    // Override presets, add custom processing stages
};
```

## Quick Start

### Installation

Copy the `DSPark/` folder into your project. Done.

```cpp
#include "DSPark/DSPark.h"
```

Requires a C++20 compiler. Tested with MSVC 19.50+, and compatible with GCC 12+, Clang 15+, Emscripten 3+.

### Process a WAV File

```cpp
#include "DSPark/DSPark.h"

int main() {
    dspark::WavFile input, output;
    input.openRead("input.wav");
    auto info = input.getInfo();

    dspark::AudioSpec spec { info.sampleRate, 512, info.numChannels };
    dspark::AudioBuffer<float> buffer(info.numChannels, 512);

    dspark::Compressor<float> comp;
    dspark::Limiter<float> lim;
    comp.prepare(spec);
    lim.prepare(spec);

    comp.setThreshold(-18.0f);
    comp.setCharacter(dspark::Compressor<float>::Character::Opto);
    lim.setCeiling(-1.0f);

    output.openWrite("output.wav", info);
    while (input.readSamples(buffer.toView())) {
        comp.processBlock(buffer.toView());
        lim.processBlock(buffer.toView());
        output.writeSamples(buffer.toView());
    }
    output.close();
}
```

### Build a Channel Strip

```cpp
using namespace dspark;

ProcessorChain<float,
    Equalizer<float>,
    Compressor<float>,
    Limiter<float>
> channelStrip;

channelStrip.prepare(spec);
channelStrip.processBlock(buffer);
```

### Per-Sample Processing (DSP Engineers)

```cpp
dspark::StateVariableFilter<float> svf;
svf.prepare(spec);
svf.setCutoff(2000.0f);
svf.setResonance(0.7f);

for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; ++i) {
    svf.setCutoff(lfo.getNextSample() * 2000 + 500);  // Modulate per sample
    auto [lp, hp, bp] = svf.processMultiOutput(input[i], 0);
    output[i] = lp;  // Or hp, bp, or any combination
}
```

### Draw an EQ Curve (Plugin GUI)

```cpp
dspark::Equalizer<float> eq;
eq.prepare(spec);
eq.setBand(0, 80.0f, 4.0f);
eq.setBand(1, 3000.0f, -2.0f, 2.0f);

// Get magnitude response for drawing
std::vector<float> freqs(512), mags(512);
for (int i = 0; i < 512; ++i)
    freqs[i] = 20.0f * std::pow(1000.0f, static_cast<float>(i) / 511.0f);

eq.getMagnitudeForFrequencyArray(freqs.data(), mags.data(), 512);
// mags[] now contains the combined EQ curve — plot it in your GUI
```

## DSParkLab — Interactive Testing App

DSParkLab is an interactive GUI application for real-time testing of every DSPark processor. Load any audio file, enable effects, tweak parameters with sliders, and hear the results instantly.

```bash
# Build (requires MSVC with C++20 support + Windows SDK for D3D11)
DSParkLab\build.bat
DSParkLab\DSParkLab.exe
```

**Features:**
- Load WAV/MP3 files with automatic format detection
- 25 effects organized by category (Filters, Dynamics, Distortion, Modulation, Spatial, Utility)
- Auto-generated parameter panels (sliders, toggles, combo boxes) from effect descriptors
- Real-time waveform display, FFT spectrum analyzer, and L/R level meters
- A/B bypass for instant comparison between original and processed audio
- Transport controls: play, pause, stop, seek, loop

Built with [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) (MIT) and [miniaudio](https://miniaud.io/) (public domain). These dependencies are bundled in `DSParkLab/vendor/` and are only used by the testing app — the DSPark framework itself remains 100% dependency-free.

## Technical Highlights

- **C++20**: Concepts (`AudioProcessor`, `SampleProcessor`, `GeneratorProcessor`), designated initializers, `std::numbers`
- **Zero allocation in audio thread**: All memory pre-allocated in `prepare()`
- **SIMD inner loops**: SSE2/AVX/NEON-accelerated buffer operations (gain, mix, peak, FIR) with automatic scalar fallback
- **Cache-friendly**: Contiguous memory, 32-byte aligned buffers
- **Thread-safe setters**: All parameters use `std::atomic` with `memory_order_relaxed` — safe to call from any thread (UI, automation, audio) with zero contention
- **No virtual dispatch in hot path**: Templates and compile-time polymorphism
- **Physically-modeled algorithms**: Tube saturation (Koren 1996 triode model), Tape (Chowdhury 2019 hysteresis), FDN reverb (Jot 1991 absorption, Householder mixing, Dattorro 1997 multi-tap output, Lexicon-style modulation, serial allpass density, allpass interpolation, tanh soft saturation)
- **Full Doxygen documentation**: Every public class and method documented
